With the release of Nutanix Prism Central 2021.7 comes additional actions to Nutanix X-Play. Nutanix X-Play is a simple low-code, no-code automation tool built into Nutanix Prism Central that helps you automate routine operations and tasks.

You can define a set of actions or series of actions called playooks based on a trigger. The trigger can be an event (such as VM creation or update), an alert (such as memory usage on a VM), or an incoming webhook. Then, you can build a series of actions that should be carried out when the trigger is fired, such as increasing memory of the affected resource, running scripts, sending e-mails, calling an API, the list goes on.

With the recent release of PC.2021.7 the following actions have been added:

- **Add to Category** - Add a VM, host, or cluster to a category
- **Remove From Category** - Remove a VM, host, or cluster from a category
- **Microsoft Teams** - Send a message to Microsoft Teams
- **Ansible** - Trigger an Ansible workflow or job template
