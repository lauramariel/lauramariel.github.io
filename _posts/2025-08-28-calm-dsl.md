## Calm DSL cheat sheet

### Installing Calm DSL container

1. Pull container image
   * Select version from https://hub.docker.com/r/nutanix/calm-dsl/tags 
   * Then, run
        ```
        export VERSION="v4.2.0" # change to match required version that matches your environment
        docker pull nutanix/calm-dsl:$VERSION
        ```

    Note: Other installation options can be found [here](https://www.nutanix.dev/docs/self-service-dsl/setup/).

2. Start the container and attach to a local directory if desired
    ```
    export LOCAL_DIR="<local-dir>"
    docker run -v $LOCAL_DIR:/mnt/local -it nutanix/calm-dsl:$VERSION 
    ```
### Connecting to PC

From within the container, run

```
calm init dsl
```

You'll need the following handy:
* PC host IP/FQDN
* PC user
* PC password
* PC project

### List blueprints

```
calm get bps
```

### Decompile existing blueprint
```
calm decompile bp <blueprint-name> [-d /mnt/local]
```
