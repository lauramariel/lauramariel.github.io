The Nutanix Test Drive for AIOps and Automation allows you to get hands on with your own Nutanix cluster and try out some of the features in Prism Pro to make your life as an IT admin easier.

To get started, navigate to https://www.nutanix.com/one-platform?type=tdops. You just need to register with an e-mail address and then you will receive an e-mail with a link to your own personal environment. If you don't receive the e-mail, be sure to check your spam folder or send an email to testdrive-help at nutanix dot com.

Once you log in, you'll be presented with the menu shown below.
